% DATA & VARIABLES
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Data}\label{sec_greta_cons:data} 
The data set for the analysis draws on data from 2019 and contains all German regions, either on the county (\textit{Kreise}, $N=401$) or municipality (\textit{Gemeinde}, $N=10,719$) level. We combine six sources of data to residualize journeys and to investigate associations between climate strike participation and electoral outcomes.




% mobile phone data
\subsection{Mobile Phone-Based Tracking Data}
The mobile phone-based tracking data is obtained from \textit{Teralytics}, which draws on the universe of customers from the \textit{Telefonica O$_2$}-network (market share of 31 percent in 2019).\footnote{source: https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/3028/umfrage/marktanteile-der-netzbetreiber-am-mobilfunkmarkt-in-deutschland-seit-1998/} The mobile network provider is a popular carrier among young people. To obtain representative mobility patterns, \textit{Teralytics} extrapolates to the entire population with the help of regional market shares. \textit{Teralytics} uses machine learning-based technology to transform mobile signals into number of journeys between two locations. For the year 2019, the data contains 64.4 billion trips. There is a required minimum time between the movements so that they count as a journey and it depends on the mode of transport.\footnote{The required minimum time is 30 minutes by car, 60 minutes by train, and 120 minutes by plane.} 

The data reports the daily number of trips between origin-destination pairs over the year 2019. Due to data privacy regulations, \textit{Teralytics} cannot report journeys if there are less than five trips for a given origin-destination pair. The spatial level of aggregation mostly coincides with county borders, only for larger metropolitan areas, there are regions with smaller clusters. For this reason, the data set provides us the number of journeys for 513 different regions, which result in more than 260,000 possible origin-destination pairs. If the length of the journey exceeds 30 km, the data can distinguish between different modes of transportation: car (6.4 percent of all trips), train (0.9 percent), and plane (< 0.03 percent).\footnote{The distance refers to the linear distance between the centroids of two geographies.} The vast majority of trips exhibit shorter distances or cannot be attributed to one of the previous transportation modes and fall into the category "not classified" (92.7 percent).






% strike data
\subsection{Climate Strike Data}
Our data on climate strikes is self-collected and comes from local authorities, social media, and the website of FFF Germany. All public gatherings such as rallies and demonstrations must be registered in Germany. The registration usually happens at the police, the city council, or other regulatory agencies. The large bulk of our database is retrieved by contacting the respective authorities and requesting a list of all climate strikes that took place in their jurisdictions in 2019. Consequently, we obtained information on the exact location and time of nearly 2,000 strikes. In the next step, we used social media postings (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) to fill up missing information for the 20 largest cities that were missing in the database. Searching for information on social media channels gave us almost another 400 climate strikes and ensured that we do not miss any large-scale climate strike. In the last step, we enriched our database with information on almost 1,600 strikes retrieved from the website of FFF Germany. Using the internet archive of \url{http://web.archive.org/}, we could restore snapshots with information on climate strikes for some weeks. The locations where the climate strikes took place are geographically encoded. Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:fff_strikes_2019} shows a map with all strikes contained in our database. There is quite some variation in the strike behavior across the year as depicted in the maps in Appendix Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:fff_strikes_months}. The same impression is obtained from Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:number_strikes_per_source}, which presents the daily number of strikes across the three sources. The highest number of strikes is reported on the global climate strike events (March, May, September, and November). Furthermore, it is visible that the strikes from the FFF website are only available in 19 weeks when the domain was archived. The other sources, however, exhibit more continuity in how they report the number of strikes.\footnote{Because of the extreme volatility of the strikes from the FFF Germany website - no information in most instances vs. detailed regional resolution on others-, we first focus on strikes for which there is more continuous information, i.e. strikes obtained from the authorities and social media.}

% Election Results
\subsection{Electoral Data}
For the European Parliament election, we use data provided by the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the Länder. For the state elections in Brandenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia, we draw on data from the State Returning Officers (\textit{Landeswahlleiter}) and the statistical offices of the Länder. In our analysis, we use the municipality-level vote share for the Greens as our dependent variable:\footnote{Our analysis excludes municipalities (around 5 percent) that were subject to territorial reforms between the elections 2015-2019.} the number of votes for the Greens divided by the total number of valid votes cast. In addition to the vote shares at the four elections in 2019, we also look at first-differences that use the corresponding counterparts in 2015. In our sample, the average vote share for the Greens is 19.68 percent. Table \ref{tab_greta_cons:data_greens_vote_share} shows that there is quite some heterogeneity across elections.

% weather data
\subsection{Weather Data}
The weather data is derived from Germany's National Meteorological Service (\textit{Deutscher Wetterdienst}). To construct the weather controls, we aggregate weather information to the county level using the weighted average (inverse distances) of the values from the individual weather monitors within a certain radius to the county's centroid.\footnote{The maximum radius depends on the weather variable. It is 30 km for precipitation, while it is 50 km for hours of sunshine and maximum air temperature.} We use daily averages of the following weather variables: hours of sunshine, precipitation, and maximum air temperature. 



% holidays
\subsection{Holidays}
To account for differences in the number of journeys between origin-destination pairs on regular and special days, we include state-level controls for public and school holidays. The data on school holidays is derived from `The Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany' (\textit{Kultusminister Konferenz}). The data on public holidays is collected from \url{https://www.schulferien.org/deutschland/feiertage/}. Additionally, we include dummy variables for peculiar days (New Year's Eve and Carnival season), which shift the expected number of journeys between origin-destination pairs.







\subsection{Other Regional Variables}
The Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the Länder provide a database (\textit{Regionaldatenbank}) of detailed statistics by different subject areas at very granular spatial levels. We draw on this database for various purposes. First, we extract municipality-level population figures that are used to construct the strike participation index and to weigh the observations when analyzing the associations between strike participation and electoral results. Second, we collect municipality-level information on topics such as per capita income, unemployment rates, and demographic characteristics that are used as controls.

\end{figure}
%--------------------------------------------

In the first part of the empirical analysis, we exploit the mobile phone-based tracking data to measure local strike participation. To determine how many participants attend a climate strike and where they come from, we residualize the number of movements between origins and destinations. We exploit a rich fixed effects model to remove the predictable variation in the number of journeys based on the origin-destination pair, date characteristics, holiday fixed effects, and weather controls. Let $\text{journeys}_{ijt}$ denote the number of journeys between origin $i$ and destination $j$ at time $t$, which in our baseline model is given by 

\begin{align}
\text{journeys}_{ijt} = \alpha + \vartheta_{ij} + \underbrace{\varphi_d+\eta_w+\psi_m}_{\gamma_t} + \lambda \mathbf{X}_{ijt}  + \varepsilon_{ijt}. \label{eq_greta_cons:res_journeys}
\end{align}

Origin-destination fixed effects are captured by $\vartheta_{ij}$ and account for time-invariant mobility patterns between origin-destination pairs (mostly on the county level with few subclusters). They ensure we use within instead of between origin-destination pair variation over time. The time fixed effects vector $\gamma_t$ contains binary variables for the day-of-the-week ($\varphi_d$), the week-of-the-year ($\eta_w$), and the month ($\psi_m$). It allows to flexibly control for weekly and seasonal mobility patterns. The vector $\mathbf{X}_{ijt} $ includes public as well as school holidays and weather controls, both at the origin and destination geography.\footnote{State-level public holiday controls contain dummy variables for All Saints' Day, Ascension Day, Assumption Day, Christmas, Corpus Christi, Epiphany, Easter, German Unity Day, Good Friday, Labor Day, New Year's Day, Penance Day, Pentecost, and Reformation Day. Furthermore, it contains binary variables for Carnival season and News Year's Eve.\newline County-level weather controls include air temperature, hours of sunshine, and precipitation.} The model explains a high proportion of the variance in the number of origin-destination journeys as the adjusted $R^2=0.9696$.


% take residuals and combine with strike database
To obtain the number and origin of people participating in climate strikes, we calculate the difference between the observed number of journeys and the predicted number of journeys conditional on the variables described above $e_{ijt} =(\text{journeys}_{ijt} - \widehat{\text{journeys}}_{ijt})$. The residuals $e_{ijt}$ capture the excess mobility net of the variation stemming from the baseline covariates. We match the daily origin-destination-level residuals with our strike database in the next step. The climate strike database contains the precise time and location for the set of destinations $j\in\{1,...,J\}$ in which a strike takes place on $t\in\{1,...,T\}$ (mostly Fridays). Consequently, $e_{ijt}$ indicates how many people are coming from origin $i$ to a strike in destination $j$ happening on day $t$. 


% example Hamburg and Berlin
Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_hh_ber} shows intuitively how the resulting strike participation measure looks like for two exemplary strikes in Hamburg and Berlin. Both of the climate strikes were visited by Greta Thunberg and attracted large populations. A darker shade of green indicates that more people in that geography were coming to one of the two strikes (locations marked in red) net of the variation stemming from the controls discussed above. The color scale classification is obtained by applying the Fisher-Jenks natural breaks algorithm. The algorithm searches for natural breaks in the data by minimizing the variance within clusters and maximizing the variance between clusters \citep{jenks1967data}. In both instances, strike participation is a relatively local phenomenon. The highest excess population flows are coming from adjacent geographies.





% robustness - alternative measurements
We perform several sensitivity tests to assess the robustness of our local strike participation measure. Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_hh_different_measure} shows maps for the climate strike in Hamburg using alternative participation measures.\footnote{The corresponding maps for the climate strike in Berlin can be found in Appendix Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_ber_different_measure}.} Throughout the paper, we focus on the baseline specification but present results when using the following alternative strike participation measures. First, we expand the baseline specification by including interactions of $\vartheta_{ij}\times\gamma_t$ in Equation \ref{eq_greta_cons:res_journeys}, i.e. origin-destination-by-day-of-the-week fixed effects, origin-destination-by-week-of-the-year fixed effects, and origin-destination-by-month fixed effects. The interactions have the advantage of allowing for systematic changes in the origin-destination-level mobility patterns over the year. The top row maps illustrate different versions of included interactions when estimating the equation with OLS. Panel A displays the baseline specification as already shown in Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_hh_ber}. Panel B adds interactions of the origin-destination fixed effects with week and month fixed effects. We refrain from also interacting the origin-destination fixed effects with the day-of-the-week fixed effects because the average strike participation would likely be absorbed by the interacted fixed effects in regions where climate strikes happen every Friday. For completeness, we show a fully interacted version in Panel C. Second, we test the robustness of the strike participation measure by estimating Equation \ref{eq_greta_cons:res_journeys} with a Poisson model to account for the discrete nature of the dependent variable. We do so by also showing the different interaction specifications discussed in the OLS case. Throughout all specifications emerges a picture of remarkable consistency. The models identify roughly the same set of regions where strike participants come from, irrespective of the modeling choices. The levels might be different, but this will not be an issue as we use standardized versions of the strike participation measure.



% validation exercise soccer
As a further check, we validate our approach to identify the origin of people attending large-scale public events by investigating the catchment areas for soccer games. In that respect, Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:participation_soccer_games} presents results for matches happening in Munich, Dortmund, and Freiburg (an example of a large, medium, and small city). Reassuringly, the maps look quite similar to the ones depicting climate strikes and illustrate that the catchment areas lie around the matches' location. However, in comparison to the climate strikes, the catchment areas are more extensive and contain the guest teams' origin.

% PATRICIPATION INDEX %--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Construction of a Strike Participation Index}

After identifying the origin of strike participants, we want to account for the intensity of local participation rates over time. Undoubtedly, there is a difference between regions with continuous strike involvement and regions with one-time events. In this section, we incorporate these considerations by constructing a cumulative municipality-level measure of strike participation across the origin regions. We define our index as follows:
	

\begin{align}
	\text{Participation Index}_{m\tilde{t}} = \left( \frac{w_{m}}{\text{population}_{m}} \sum\limits_{t=1}^{\tilde{t}}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{J} e_{ijt}\right), \label{eq_greta_cons:participation_index}
\end{align}


where $\text{Participation Index}_{m\tilde{t}}$ is a cumulative measure of relative strike participation in origin municipality $m$ at time period $\tilde{t}$. It comprises the following elements: $\sum_{t=1}^{\tilde{t}}\sum_{j=1}^{J} e_{ijt}$ indicates the cumulative strike participation in county $i$ up to time $\tilde{t}$ (for instance when an election takes place).\footnote{We only select non-negative residuals to obtain throughout positive values of strike participation.} We sum over destinations $j$ to account for the fact that individuals residing in $i$ are going to climate strikes in more than one destination. Furthermore, we sum over all times $t\in\{1,...,\tilde{t}\}$ in which county $i$ appears as an origin for a strike in any destination $j$. The weights $w_{mi}$ allocate the strike participation from the county to the municipality level. They are defined as $w_m=\tfrac{\text{population }[minors]_m}{\sum_{r=1}^{R}\text{population }[minors]_r}$, in other words the share of young people (aged 0-17) living in municipality $m$ compared to other municipalities $r\in\{1,...,R\}$ in county $i$. The weights resemble the idea that strike participation should be higher in municipalities with many young people relative to municipalities with few young people. We restrain our weights to minors, i.e. the population share that is not allowed to vote, with the purpose to not generate associations with electoral outcomes by construction. Finally, we take the number of cumulative strike participants in municipality $m$ at time $\tilde{t}$ and divide it by the municipality's population figure to have a relative measure.

The color scales in panels A-C correspond to quintiles. To generate the bivariate color scale in panel D, we blend the two univariate scales (in terciles, $\Delta$ Greens in red and participation index in blue) into one. Bold lines indicate state boundaries, thin lines represent municipality borders.}
