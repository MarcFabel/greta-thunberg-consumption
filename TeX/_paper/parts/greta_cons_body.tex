\section{Introduction}\label{sec_greta_cons:intro}

While the scientific case for policies mitigating climate change is clear, the political will for bold action remains limited. One pathway out of this dilemma is for voters to no longer accept the risks of climate-related problems and demand political change. Yet, because of the long-term character of climate change risks and the likely delay before mitigating policies will pay off, the support for decisive action against climate change can differ substantially across generations. Indeed, as opposed to older generations, today's young are typically much less likely to accept the status quo as they will experience the brunt of projected mid-century impacts of climate change \citep{hersch2006generational}. Children and youth, in particular, have often been at the forefront of demanding adaptive measures against climate change. Already in 1992, during the UN Climate Conference in Rio de Janeiro, the then 12-year old Severn Cullis-Suzuki addressed delegates by stressing that: 
\begin{quote}
	\textit{“You must change your ways; […] losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market”.}
\end{quote}
Since then, the consequences of human-caused climate change have become ever more visible, as evidenced by new temperature records almost every year, the melting of the polar ice caps, and the appearance of more extreme weather phenomena.  Tellingly, over the course of 2019, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen climate activist, has inspired especially young people around the globe to stage some of the largest environmental protests in history. For instance, on Friday, September 20, 2019 during the Global Week for Future, roughly four million protestors in more than 150 countries demanded action to fight climate change. 


Against this background, our aim is to examine whether school strikes that recently set the tone for environmental protest action around the world (“Fridays For Future”, henceforth FFF) led to political and economic change. In economics, a large literature examines the transmission of values and attitudes from adults to children, and its consequences for children’s behavior \citep{bisin2001economics,figlio2019longterm}. By contrast, our hypothesis centers around reverse intergenerational transmission: youth's participation in environmental protests may raise environmental awareness among their parents' generation and society as whole. This, in turn, may trigger consumption changes towards more environmentally-friendly products, cause adjustments in mobility and travel behavior, and lead to higher demand for ``green politics'' aimed at mitigating the negative effects of climate change. 

The specific question we attempt to answer in this paper is: Did the mobilization of young people to the climate cause have a discernible impact on electoral outcomes in general, and on the demand for green politics in particular? We strive to shed light on this question by studying the spread of FFF climate strikes in Germany. Inspired by Greta Thunberg's \emph{Skolstrejk f\"{o}r klimatet} in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018, FFF quickly turned into a large social movement of school students who skip classes, mostly on Fridays, to participate in mass strikes over climate change inaction. In Germany, a first few climate strikes took place in mid-December 2018, and the FFF movement then gained significant momentum over the course of 2019, staging thousands of local climate strikes across the country. The strike activity reached its peak during the Global Week of Climate action in September, when roughly 1.4 million individuals participated in climate protests.  

In the first part of the paper, our core contribution is to develop a time-varying, municipality-level measure of youth's propensity to participate in climate strikes. This is a non-trivial challenge due to the geography of mass protests: while strikes are often organized in some central location (e.g., the main city of a region), its participants typically originate both from within and outside that location (e.g., neighboring or more distant municipalities). We tackle this challenge in three steps. First, based on information we collected from police forces, city councils, municipal authorities, and social media, we build up a database consisting of more than 2,300 climate strikes in over 330 German cities during 2019. Second, exploiting cell phone-based tracking data consisting of daily counts of journeys between 260,000 origin-destination pairs, we compute the excess mobility between locations by taking residuals from regressions of the number of journeys between origin $i$ and destination $j$ on day $t$ on a rich set of fixed effects and controls. Third, merging the daily origin-destination mobility residuals with our strike database, we obtain a measure of protest participation that proxies for each strike the geographic distribution of its participants. Crucially, this measure allows us to trace out how protest participation in support of FFF evolved across time and space in Germany. We perform several sensitivity tests to assess the robustness of our strike participation measure, and validate our approach for identifying the geographic distribution of individuals attending mass events by examining professional soccer games.  

In the second part of the paper, we use time-series and municipality-level variation in our protest participation data to study the role of youth environmental activism in adults' voting behavior. Over the course of 2019, Germany saw four elections: a nation-wide EU election in spring and three federal state elections spread out over the second half of the year. In all four ballots, and especially in the nation-wide EU election, voter turnout increased substantially compared to previous elections, and in three out of four elections this increase was accompanied by a sharp rise in the vote share of the Green Party. In particular during its EU election campaign, one of the Green Party's main objectives had been to label the ballot as a ``climate election''. On the night of the election day, Michael Kellner, the party's secretary general, announced that he was extremely satisfied that his party was able to turn the election into a ``Sunday for Future''. Against this background, we investigate two municipality-level electoral outcomes: voter turnout and the share of votes cast for the Green Party. To purge unmeasured municipality-level, time-invariant factors that may determine a general tendency to vote ``green'', we implement a first-differences strategy that compares electoral results in different years (2015 vs. 2019). %Our main dependent variable is a cumulative v, measured up to an election date.  

Our first set of results shows a positive, large and significant correlation between youth's propensity to participate in climate strikes and voter turnout. In terms of magnitude, a one standard deviation increase in our strike participation index is associated with a roughly 10 percent of a standard deviation higher voter turnout. Putting this further into perspective, in the context of the elections we study, the estimated correlation corresponds to 5 percent of the average increase in voter turnout between 2015 and 2019. 

For our second set of results, we establish that in municipalities where youth were highly active in climate protests, the Green Party witnessed larger vote gains compared to previous elections than in municipalities with a lower degrees of youth environmental activism. In quantitative terms, we find that a one standard deviation increase in our strike participation index maps into a 8 percent of a standard deviation higher vote share for the Green Party. For the elections we study, the estimated correlation amounts to roughly 4 percent of the Green Party's average vote gains between 2015 and 2019. Taken together, we interpret this evidence as suggesting that youth's protest participation in support of FFF played a non-negligible role in  (i) encouraging adult voters to take to the polls and (ii) their demand for green politics. 

Our paper touches upon several strands of literature. First, while a substantial literature in economics has highlighted how older generations transmit preferences, norms and beliefs to younger generations  \citep{bisin2001economics,fernandez2004mothers,fernandez2009culture,figlio2019longterm}, there only exist a few studies, mostly outside of economics, that has looked into reverse intergenerational transmission. This body of work has established, \emph{inter alia}, that younger generations influence their parents' attitudes towards a variety of controversial topics, including unhealthy consumption behaviors \citep{flurry2005children}, the use of modern technology \citep{baily2009reverse}, and views on sexual orientation \citep{lasala2000lesbians}. A particularly relevant subset of studies has explored whether children can foster climate change concern among their parents. Based on a controlled trial in the Seychelles, \citet{damerell2013child} show that adults exhibit greater knowledge of wetlands and improved water management behavior when their child has received wetland-based environmental education. In a similar vein in the United States, \citet{lawson2019children}  present an experimental evaluation of an educational intervention designed to build climate change concern among parents through their middle school-aged children, finding that parents of children in the treatment group expressed higher levels of climate change concern than parents in the control group. 


Second, our paper has antecedents in a small but insightful literature that examines the impact of social and political movements. Studying the Tea Party protests in the United States, \citet{madestam2013political} establish that the movement has caused a shift to the right in terms of policymaking, both directly through incumbent politicians' decision-making and indirectly through voters' selection of politicians in elections. Using daily variation in the number protesters during Egypt's Arab Spring, \citet{acemoglu2018power} show that more intense protests are associated with lower stock market valuations of firms connected to politicians in power relative to unconnected firms. In addition, several papers have studied the determinants of protest participation \citep{finkel1991party,finkel1998rational,cantoni2019protests,bursztyn2020persistent}. An interesting but not directly related phenomenon is described by \citet{depetris2020building}: collectively  shared  experiences  of  the  type  induced  by  mass sport events---in particular international  football games in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa---can  shape  identities  in  ways  that  can  help  build  national  sentiment  at  the  expense  of  ethnic  identification.  


Finally, our work relates to studies that use cell phone data to examine economically and socially important phenomena. A large part of this literature centers around the investigation of social network patterns \citep{onnela2007structure,onnela2011geographic,kovanen2013temporal}. Beyond this, cell phone records have recently been used to predict the spatial distribution of urban economic activity from commuting choices \citep{NBERw28516} and to assess the contagion externality of mass events \citep{dave2020contagion}. We instead exploit cell phone-based tracking data to measure the spread of a major social movement across time and space.


The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide background information on the Fridays for Future movement. Section 3 contains a description of the data we use. In Section 4, we lay out our methodology for measuring youth's climate protest participation across time and space. In Section 5, we explore the role of youth environmental activism in adults' voting behavior, discussing our empirical strategy before presenting the results. The final section concludes.

}
% general intro 
\textit{Fridays for Future} (henceforth FFF) is a global social movement consisting to a large extent of school students that claim comprehensive, fast, and efficient measures for climate protection. The students skip school, mostly on Fridays, to lay emphasis on their key demand: to adhere to the targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement to lower global carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions in order to limit the associated increase in global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Parts of the scientific community (\textit{Scientists for Future}) have stood in solidarity with FFF, declaring the concerns as justified and expressing support for the demands put forward by FFF \citep{warren2019thousands,hagedorn2019science}. The movement is organized in local chapters that plan weekly school strikes for the climate and regular large-scale coordinated marches \citep{smith2019window}. In 2019, there have been four large-scale global climate strikes in March, May, September, and November. For instance, alone for the third global climate strike in September 2019, FFF organized 6,000 protests in 185 countries, which mobilized 7.6 million participants \citep{demoor2020protest}. The exact dates of the global climate strikes and other relevant events are presented in the timeline in Panel (a) of Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:timeline_media_awareness}.


%Greta Thunberg
\textbf{The Role of Greta Thunberg.---}The movement received its initial impulse from Greta Thunberg, the then 15-year old Swedish teenager, who started her \textit{Skolstrejk för klimatet} (school strike for climate) in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. Her actions quickly received media attention around the world. Greta Thunberg soon started to advocate her goals at important international events such as the 2018 Climate Change Conference in Katowice, the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2019, in front of the European Parliament on April 16, or the United Nations (UN) climate change conference in Madrid in December 2019. She sailed across the Atlantic to deliver her famous speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019 (`how dare you?'). The movement's success is tightly related to her, not only on the world stage but also on a more local, personal level. A `Greta Effect' has been documented in many dimensions: it ranges from increases in carbon offsetting projects  \citep{guardian2019greta_effect} to a reduction in the number of airline passengers due to `flight-shaming' \citep{economist2019greta_effect}. Most importantly, Greta Thunberg acted as a role model for many young people's decision to take part in the climate strikes. During the first global climate strike on March 15, roughly 45 percent of German students stated that Greta Thunberg influenced their decision to participate in the event \citep{sommer2019fridays}. The effect of Greta Thunberg as a role model has been more pronounced for girls than for boys. Greta Thunberg's commitment to fighting for climate change mitigation was acknowledged by various prestigious honors and awards such as the Right Livelihood Award (promoted as the `Alternative Nobel Prize'), being the youngest `Time Person of the Year' in 2019, and two consecutive nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize (in 2019 and 2020).

% Germany and 2019 in general
\textbf{The German Context.---}In Germany, the first strikes started in mid-December 2018 in a handful of cities.\footnote{The following information on the German context stems, except where otherwise noted, from \cite{sommer2019fridays}.} By mid-January 2019, there were already 25,000 protesters in 50 places, according to the organizers of FFF. The movement gained momentum in March due to Greta Thunberg's visits in Hamburg and Berlin on March 1 and 29,\footnote{The two strikes that were vistited by Greta Thunberg in March 2019 attracted large populations. According to the organizers, there were 10,000 students in Hamburg and 25,000 people in Berlin.} and the first global climate strike on March 15. On that day, there were an estimated 300,000 protesters on German streets, and almost 1.8 million protesters participated worldwide. The second global climate strike took place just before the 2019 elections for the European Parliament in order to allow a significant impact on electoral outcomes \citep{smith2019window}. FFF had declared the 2019 EU election as the `climate election' (\#voteforclimate) and green parties obtained historically good results all across Europe. In Germany, there were 218 events (more than in any other country) and different election surveys indicated that environmental issues and the topic of climate change affected voters in the election \citep{Time2019may24}. The first international climate strike took place in Aachen on June 21. The strike activity culminated in the Global Week of Climate Action in September. During that week on September 20, the day of the third global climate strike, the largest climate strikes in world history were reported \citep{guardian2019weekofaction}. While more than 7.6 million individuals participated in climate strikes globally, the numbers amounted to 1.4 million protesters in 550 cities in Germany (alone in Berlin there were almost 300,000) \citep{demoor2020protest}. The strikes were timed to increase pressure to take action mitigating climate change ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. On September 20, the German government also announced a 54 billion climate change package, which included the introduction of a price per ton of emitted CO$_2$. The fourth and last global climate strike in 2019 happened on November 29, again just days before the UN Climate Change Conference started in Madrid. The estimated strike participation had declined and about 630,000 individuals joined the strike in Germany \citep{zeit20194cgs}. 
%While the introduction may be seen as a success for FFF, the initially suggested price of 10 euros per ton CO$_2$ was significantly lower than what was demanded by FFF and several experts \citep{economist2019klimapaket}.
%In late autumn, there were sporadic reports about disappointment and resignation with respect to the achievements with the climate package. If the wave of enthusiasm surrounding FFF was about the break, it was surely done by the onset of the Corona pandemic in the spring of 2020 \citep{ZEIT2020}.



% Teilnehmer
\textbf{Who Are the Participants?---}The results from surveys conducted at strikes allow drawing a profile of FFF participants \citep{sommer2019fridays,demoor2020protest}. During the first global climate strike in March 2019, almost three out of four protesters were students (school or university), and 60 percent of participants were female. Roughly 70 percent of the respondents located themselves at the center-left of the political spectrum which is far above the value for the general population. Many participants come from upper-middle-class households, as indicated by high levels of (parental) educational attainment. The share of mothers (fathers) with a university degree was 45.8 (49.4) percent, values that are twice as high compared to the population average. The protesters are on average largely inexperienced with demonstrations (40\% no experience, 42\% attended few demonstrations) and were mobilized through either social media (37\%) or interpersonal channels (31.5\%), such as friends and schoolmates.




% rolle von medien -> einfluss auf einstellung
\textbf{The Importance of (Social) Media.---}The media coverage on the topic of FFF was crucial for the movement's success. The first coverage in Germany started already in the late autumn of 2018.
While the initial coverage was centered around the violation of compulsory school attendance, it soon reported more on the contents of the demands made by FFF. Panel (b) of Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:timeline_media_awareness} shows the share of articles covering FFF in German print media over the year 2019. The data is obtained via webscraping from Genios that provides an archive containing almost 300 daily and weekly outlets in Germany. There are clear spikes in media coverage around each of the global climate strikes in March, May, September, and November. The maximum share of articles is attained during the Global Week of Climate Action: more than 3.2 percent of all print articles in Germany were reporting on FFF. The same tendency holds for social media. Panel (c) of Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:timeline_media_awareness} shows the weekly number of favorites and retweets of Greta Thunberg's tweets. Again, the attention in Greta Thunberg's tweets culminates with the global climate strikes. The Appendix gives further insights into the content of Greta Thunberg's tweets.\footnote{Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:twitter_greta_thunberg_top_words_hashtags_mentions} gives an overview of the most widely used words, hashtags, and mentions. Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:twitter_greta_sentiment_length} displays information on the sentiment and the length of the tweets. Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:twitter_favorites_activists} plots the weekly number of favorites of influential German climate activists, such as Luisa Neubauer.}



% shift in public opinion
\textbf{Public Opinion.---}Related to the increase in media coverage is a rapid shift in public opinion on environmental issues \citep{smith2019window}. The Institute for election research (\textit{Forschungsgruppe Wahlen e.V.}) has been conducting the survey \cite{politbarometer2019} for more than 40 years, which regularly polls attitudes with regard to political parties, current issues, and delivers projections for upcoming elections. One question in the survey asks about respondent's opinion on the two most pressing current issues in the Federal Republic of Germany. The large graph in Panel C of Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:timeline_media_awareness} shows that the share of respondents who report that the environment as a high-priority issue is increasing significantly from around 10 percent to almost 60 percent over the year 2019. The small graph plots the long-run development since 2000 (the year 2019 is highlighted in green). Before the year 2019, an average share of four percent reported that the environment is among the top two pressing issues.\footnote{Before 2019, a maximum share of 14.5 percent of respondents reported the environment as a top issue.} Respondents also reported that they expect the climate strikes and the associated sudden spike in environmental awareness would lead to political changes \citep{ForschungsgruppeWahlen2019FFF}. While 37 percent of respondents expected an impact on politics in April 2019, the share was already 51 percent at the end of June.



%In Germany, the idea to rise awareness for ecological issues and fight environmental pollution is not new. There has been a decades-long environmental movement \citep{smith2019window}. Recently, however, school strikes set the tone for environmental protest.

% DATA & VARIABLES
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\bigskip
\section{Data}\label{sec_greta_cons:data} 
Our main sample uses data from 2019 and contains all German regions, either on the county (\textit{Kreise}, $N=401$) or municipality (\textit{Gemeinde}, $N=10,719$) level. We combine six sources of data to residualize journeys and to investigate associations between climate strike participation and electoral outcomes.

	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


% cell phone data
\subsection{Cell Phone-Based Tracking Data}
The cell phone-based tracking data is obtained from \textit{Teralytics}, which draws on the universe of customers from the \textit{Telefonica O$_2$}-network. The mobile network provider had a market share of 31 percent in 2019 \citep{statista2020marktanteil} and is a popular carrier among young people.\footnote{To obtain representative mobility patterns, \textit{Teralytics} extrapolates to the entire population with the help of regional market shares.} \textit{Teralytics} uses machine learning-based technology to transform mobile signals into a number of journeys between two locations.\footnote{There is a required minimum time between individual movements so that they count as a completed journey, depending on the mode of transport: It is 30 minutes by car, 60 minutes by train, and 120 minutes by plane.} The data reports the daily number of trips between origin-destination pairs, which is the unit of observation in the first part of the empirical analysis. Over the year 2019, the data contains 64.4 billion trips in total. Due to data privacy regulations, \textit{Teralytics} cannot report journeys if there are fewer than five trips for a given origin-destination pair per day, resulting in missing observations. The spatial level of aggregation mostly coincides with county borders. Only for larger metropolitan areas, there are regions with smaller clusters. For this reason, the data set provides us the number of journeys for 513 different geographies, which result in more than 260,000 possible origin-destination pairs.\footnote{For 355 counties, the geographies overlap with the county borders. The remaining 46 counties are split into subclusters, with a maximum of five subclusters for the largest metropolitan areas.} The vast majority of trips (92.7 percent) do not exceed 30 kilometers.\footnote{The distance refers to the linear distance between the centroids of two geographies.} For larger distances, the data can distinguish between different modes of transportation.
% car (6.4 percent of all trips), train (0.9 percent), and plane (< 0.03 percent). The vast majority of trips exhibit shorter distances or cannot be attributed to one of the previous transportation modes and fall into the category "not classified" (92.7 percent).

	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}



% strike data
\subsection{Climate Strike Data}
Our data on climate strikes is self-collected and comes from local authorities, social media, and the website of FFF Germany. All public gatherings such as rallies and demonstrations must be registered in Germany. The registration usually happens at the police, the city council, or other regulatory agencies. The large bulk of our database is retrieved by contacting the respective authorities and requesting a list of all climate strikes that took place in their jurisdictions in 2019. Consequently, we obtained information on the exact location and time of nearly 2,000 strikes. In the next step, we used social media postings (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) to fill up missing information for the 20 largest cities that were missing in the database. Searching for information on social media channels gave us almost another 400 climate strikes and ensured that we do not miss any large-scale climate strike. In the last step, we enriched our database with information on almost 1,600 strikes retrieved from the website of FFF Germany. Using the internet archive of \url{www.web.archive.org}, we could restore snapshots with information on climate strikes for some weeks. After combining the information from the different sources, the locations where the climate strikes took place were geographically encoded. Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:fff_strikes_2019} shows a map with all strikes contained in our database. There is considerable variation in the strike behavior across the year as depicted in the maps in Appendix Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:fff_strikes_months}. The same impression is obtained from Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:number_strikes_per_source}, which presents the daily number of strikes across the three sources. The highest number of strikes is reported on the global climate strike events (March, May, September, and November). Furthermore, it is visible that the strikes from the FFF website are only available in 19 weeks when the domain was archived. The other sources, however, exhibit more continuity in how they report the number of strikes.\footnote{Because of the extreme volatility of the strikes from the FFF Germany website - no information in most instances vs. detailed regional resolution on others-, we first focus on strikes for which there is more continuous information, i.e. strikes obtained from the authorities and social media.} 










% Election Results
\subsection{Electoral Data}
For the European Parliament election, we use data provided by the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the Länder. For the state elections in Brandenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia, we draw on data from the State Returning Officers (\textit{Landeswahlleiter}) and the statistical offices of the Länder. In our analysis, we use the municipality-level voter turnout and the vote share for the Greens (\textit{Bündnis 90/Die Grünen}) as our dependent variable.\footnote{Our analysis excludes municipalities (around 5 percent) that were subject to territorial reforms between the elections 2015-2019.} The vote share is defined as the number of votes for the Greens divided by the total number of valid votes cast. In addition to the vote shares at the four elections in 2019, we also look at first-differences that use the corresponding counterparts in 2015. In our sample, the average vote share for the Greens is 19.68 percent. Table \ref{tab_greta_cons:data_greens_vote_share} shows that there is substantial heterogeneity across elections.



% tab election vote share greens
\input{greta_cons_tab__vote_share_greens_elections}








% weather data
\subsection{Weather Data}
The weather data is derived from Germany's National Meteorological Service (\textit{Deutscher Wetterdienst}). To construct the weather controls, we aggregate weather information to the county level using the weighted average (inverse distances) of the values from the individual weather monitors within a certain radius to the county's centroid.\footnote{The maximum radius depends on the weather variable. It is 30 km for precipitation, while it is 50 km for hours of sunshine and maximum air temperature.} We use daily averages of the following weather variables: hours of sunshine, precipitation, and maximum air temperature. 



% holidays
\subsection{Holidays}
To account for differences in the number of journeys between origin-destination pairs on regular and special days, we include state-level controls for public and school holidays. The data on school holidays is derived from `The Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany' (\textit{Kultusminister Konferenz}). The data on public holidays is collected from \url{www.schulferien.org}. Additionally, we include dummy variables for peculiar days (New Year's Eve and Carnival season), which shift the expected number of journeys between origin-destination pairs.







\subsection{Other Regional Variables}
The Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the Länder provide a database (\textit{Regionaldatenbank}) of detailed statistics by different subject areas at very granular spatial levels. We draw on this database for various purposes. First, we extract municipality-level population figures that are used to construct the strike participation index and to weigh the observations when analyzing the associations between strike participation and electoral results. Second, we collect municipality-level information on topics such as per capita income, unemployment rates, and demographic characteristics that are used as controls.

\subsection{Residualize Journeys and Combine with Strike Data Base}

%--------------------------------------------
% fig: strike participation for selected strikes
\input{greta_cons_fig__strike_participation_hh_ber}
%--------------------------------------------

In the first part of the empirical analysis, we exploit the cell phone-based tracking data to measure local strike participation. To determine how many participants attend a climate strike and where they come from, we residualize the number of movements between origins and destinations. We exploit a rich fixed effects model to remove the predictable variation in the number of journeys based on the origin-destination pair, date characteristics, holiday fixed effects, and weather controls. Let $\text{journeys}_{ijt}$ denote the number of journeys between origin $i$ and destination $j$ at time $t$, which in our baseline model is given by 
\begin{align}
\text{journeys}_{ijt} = \alpha + \vartheta_{ij} + \underbrace{\varphi_d+\eta_w+\psi_m}_{\gamma_t} + \lambda \mathbf{X}_{ijt} + \varepsilon_{ijt}. \label{eq_greta_cons:res_journeys}
\end{align}
Origin-destination fixed effects are captured by $\vartheta_{ij}$ and account for time-invariant mobility patterns between origin-destination pairs (mostly on the county level with few subclusters). They ensure we use within instead of between origin-destination pair variation over time. The time fixed effects vector $\gamma_t$ contains binary variables for the day-of-the-week ($\varphi_d$), the week-of-the-year ($\eta_w$), and the month ($\psi_m$). It allows to flexibly control for weekly and seasonal mobility patterns. The vector $\mathbf{X}_{ijt} $ includes public as well as school holidays and weather controls, both at the origin and destination geography.\footnote{State-level public holiday controls contain dummy variables for All Saints' Day, Ascension Day, Assumption Day, Christmas, Corpus Christi, Epiphany, Easter, German Unity Day, Good Friday, Labor Day, New Year's Day, Penance Day, Pentecost, and Reformation Day. Furthermore, it contains binary variables for Carnival season and News Year's Eve. County-level weather controls include air temperature, hours of sunshine, and precipitation.} The model explains a high proportion of the variance in the number of origin-destination journeys as the adjusted $R^2=0.9696$.

To obtain the number and origin of people participating in climate strikes, we calculate the difference between the observed number of journeys and the predicted number of journeys conditional on the variables described above $e_{ijt} =(\text{journeys}_{ijt} - \widehat{\text{journeys}}_{ijt})$. The residuals $e_{ijt}$ capture the excess mobility net of the variation stemming from the baseline covariates. We match the daily origin-destination-level residuals with our strike database in the next step. The climate strike database contains the precise time and location for the set of destinations $j\in\{1,...,J\}$ in which a strike takes place on $t\in\{1,...,T\}$ (mostly Fridays). Consequently, $e_{ijt}$ indicates how many people are coming from origin $i$ to a strike in destination $j$ happening on day $t$. 


% example Hamburg and Berlin
Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_hh_ber} shows intuitively how the resulting strike participation measure looks like for two exemplary strikes in Hamburg and Berlin. Both of the climate strikes were visited by Greta Thunberg and attracted large populations. A darker shade of green indicates that more people in that geography were coming to one of the two strikes (locations marked in red) net of the variation stemming from the controls discussed above. The color scale classification is obtained by applying the Fisher-Jenks natural breaks algorithm. The algorithm searches for natural breaks in the data by minimizing the variance within clusters and maximizing the variance between clusters \citep{jenks1967data}. In both instances, strike participation is a relatively local phenomenon. The highest excess population flows are coming from adjacent geographies.

% robustness - alternative measurements
We perform several sensitivity tests to assess the robustness of our local strike participation measure. Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_hh_different_measure} shows maps for the climate strike in Hamburg using alternative participation measures.\footnote{The corresponding maps for the climate strike in Berlin can be found in Appendix Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_ber_different_measure}.} First, we expand the baseline specification by including interactions of $\vartheta_{ij}\times\gamma_t$ in Equation \ref{eq_greta_cons:res_journeys}, i.e. origin-destination-by-day-of-the-week fixed effects, origin-destination-by-week-of-the-year fixed effects, and origin-destination-by-month fixed effects. The interactions have the advantage of allowing for systematic changes in the origin-destination-level mobility patterns over the year. The top row maps illustrate different versions of included interactions when estimating the equation with OLS. Panel A displays the baseline specification as already shown in Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_hh_ber}. Panel B adds interactions of the origin-destination fixed effects with week and month fixed effects. We refrain from also interacting the origin-destination fixed effects with the day-of-the-week fixed effects because the interaction would likely absorb the average strike participation in regions where climate strikes happen every Friday. For completeness, we show a fully interacted version in Panel C. Second, we test the robustness of the strike participation measure by estimating Equation \ref{eq_greta_cons:res_journeys} with a Poisson model to account for the discrete nature of the dependent variable. We do so by also showing the different interaction specifications discussed in the OLS case. Throughout all specifications emerges a picture of remarkable consistency. The models identify roughly the same set of regions where strike participants come from, irrespective of the modeling choices. The levels might be different, but this will not be an issue as we use standardized versions of the strike participation measure. Throughout the paper, we focus on the baseline specification but also present results for the alternative strike participation measures discussed above.



% validation exercise soccer
As a further check, we validate our approach to identify the origin of people attending other large-scale public events by investigating the catchment areas for soccer games. In that respect, Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:participation_soccer_games} presents results for matches happening in Munich, Dortmund, and Freiburg (an example of a large, medium, and small city). Reassuringly, the maps look similar to those depicting climate strikes and illustrate that the catchment areas lie around the matches' location. However, in comparison to the climate strikes, the catchment areas are a bit more extensive and contain the guest teams' origin.















% PATRICIPATION INDEX %--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Construction of a Municipality-Level Participation Index}

After identifying the origin of strike participants, we want to account for the intensity of local participation rates over time. The idea is to differentiate between regions with continuous and sporadic strike involvement. In this section, we incorporate these considerations by constructing a cumulative measure of strike participation at the municipality-level. We define our index as follows:
\begin{align}
	\text{Participation Index}_{m\tilde{t}} = \left( \frac{w_{mi}}{\text{population}_{m}} \sum\limits_{t=1}^{\tilde{t}}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{J} e_{ijt}\right), \label{eq_greta_cons:participation_index}
\end{align}
where $\text{Participation Index}_{m\tilde{t}}$ is a cumulative measure of relative strike participation in origin municipality $m$ up to a specific point in time $\tilde{t}$ (for instance when an election takes place). It comprises the following elements: $\sum_{t=1}^{\tilde{t}}\sum_{j=1}^{J} e_{ijt}$ indicates the cumulative strike participation in county $i$ up to time $\tilde{t}$.\footnote{We only select non-negative residuals to obtain positive values of strike participation.} We sum over destinations $j$ to account for the fact that individuals residing in $i$ are going to climate strikes in more than one destination. Furthermore, we sum over all days up to and including $\tilde{t}$ in which county $i$ appears as an origin for a strike in any destination $j$. The weights $w_{mi}$ allocate the strike participation from the county to the municipality level. They are defined as the share of children (aged 0-17) living in municipality $m$ in relation to other municipalities in county $i$. The weights reflect the notion that strike participation should be higher in municipalities with many young people relative to municipalities with few young people. We restrain our weights to minors, i.e. the population share that is not allowed to vote, with the purpose to not generate associations with electoral outcomes by construction. Finally, we take the number of cumulative strike participants in municipality $m$ at time $\tilde{t}$ and divide it by the municipality's population figure to obtain a relative measure.

\section{Strike Participation and Electoral Outcomes}\label{sec_greta_cons:strike_participation_elections}



% EMPIRICAL STRATEGY %--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Empirical Strategy}


Our approach to investigating the relationship between strike participation and electoral results is based on a fixed-effects model, which exploits within-state and within-election variation of local strike participation rates. We estimate the following model:\footnote{For many aspects in this section's empirical approach, we found inspiration in the study of \cite{cantoni2020persistence} who investigate the municipality-level relationship between the support for Germany's Nazi party in 1933 and the likelihood to vote for the `Alternative for Germany', an increasingly right-wing populist party.}
\begin{align}
	\text{Share Greens}_{me} = \theta_s + \tau_e + \beta\cdot\text{Participation Index}_{me} + \mu \mathbf{X}_{1m} + \xi_{me},\label{eq_greta_cons:vote_share_greens}
\end{align}
where $\text{Share Greens}_{me}$ is the Greens' vote share in municipality $m$ for election $e$, which we define as the number of votes for the Greens relative to the total number of valid votes cast. We regress the dependent variable on state and election fixed effects ($\theta_s$ and $\tau_e$). The $\text{Participation Index}_{me}$ captures the cumulative relative strike participation up to the time when election $e$ takes place. For some specifications, we also include a set of municipality-level controls $\mathbf{X}_{1m}$, such as income, unemployment, and demographic characteristics. 


% first-difference
To eliminate unobserved time-invariant municipality specific effects, such as a general tendency to vote for the Greens, we employ a first-differences strategy in which we examine the \textit{change} in the vote share. Let $\Delta(\text{Share Greens}_{me,2019-2015})$ denote the change in the Greens' vote share from 2015 to 2019 in municipality $m$ for election $e$, which is given by
\begin{align}
	\Delta(\text{Share Greens}_{me,2019-2015}) = \theta_s + \tau_e + \beta\cdot\text{Participation Index}_{me} + \mu \mathbf{X}_{2m} + \xi_{me}.\label{eq_greta_cons:fd_vote_share_greens}
\end{align}
Although first-differencing removes time-invariant municipality specific effects, we still include in some specifications a set of controls $\mathbf{X}_{2m}$ (potentially different to $\mathbf{X}_{1m}$ in Equation \ref{eq_greta_cons:vote_share_greens}) to allow for time-varying effects of covariates.


In both Equations \ref{eq_greta_cons:vote_share_greens} and \ref{eq_greta_cons:fd_vote_share_greens}, all variables, dependent and explanatory alike, are standardized. $\beta$ is the parameter of interest and captures the relationship between local strike participation rates and the (change in the) greens' vote share. The parameter reports the change in the outcome variable in standard deviation units due to a one standard deviation increase of the participation index. Observations are weighted by population figures from the Federal Statistical Office. For analyses at the municipality level, we calculate sandwiched standard error estimates allowing errors to be correlated across municipalities corresponding to the same county---i.e., clustered at the county level. For regressions at the county level, we use robust standard errors.

%--------------------------------------------

% descriptive
Before presenting regression results, we show descriptive evidence on the variables of interest. Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:spatial_correlation_greens_index} contains maps displaying geographic patterns by grouping municipalities into quintiles according to the variables' distribution. Panel A shows the regional variation in the Greens' vote share in the 2019 European elections, indicating a clear East-West divide in the Greens' election results. The Greens achieve their best results in urban areas of Western Germany, and with the exception of Berlin and three urban areas, the Greens are less successful in Eastern Germany (22.31 percent in West vs 10.35 percent in the East). Panel B shows the geographical variation of the change in the Greens' vote share between the 2015 and 2019 EU elections. Regions with the largest gains in votes can be found in the West and North of Germany as well as in large metropolitan regions. Panel C presents the spatial distribution of the standardized participation index at the time of the 2019 EU election. There is extensive regional variation with generally higher values in urban centers. The bivariate map in Panel D shows the correlation between changes in the Greens' vote share and the protest participation index. To obtain the bivariate distribution, we divide municipalities into terciles of changes in the Greens' vote share (in red) and the participation index (in blue), resulting in a 3$\times$3 matrix of possible outcomes. Areas in the map in a shade of red (without blue tinge) indicate changes in the vote share of the Green party with low protest participation rates. Areas in the map in a shade of blue (without red tinge) indicate different levels of protest participation with low vote share for the Green party. For areas with medium or high vote shares and protest participation, the two corresponding colors are blended into one resulting in the color matrix shown with the map. Geographies depicted in colors from the diagonal support the notion that electoral results are correlated with participation rates. Low participation rates and low vote shares for the Greens are prevalent in Eastern Germany. In contrast, high participation and high voting shares for the Greens are common in North-Western Germany and Baden-Württemberg. To control for state-level variation in both (changes in the) vote shares for the Green party and protest participation, we include state fixed effects in all specifications.

% regressions
Table \ref{tab_greta_cons:associations_part_greens} presents results from estimating regression equations \ref{eq_greta_cons:vote_share_greens} and \ref{eq_greta_cons:fd_vote_share_greens}. In column 1, we estimate the relationship between FFF participation and the vote share of the Green Party in 2019 at the municipality level. State-level fixed effects control for state-level time-invariant factors that may have affected FFF participation or the Greens' vote share such as political, economic or cultural differences that may lead to differences in susceptibility for environmental topics between states. Election fixed effects control for election-level factors that influence the overall or change in the Greens' vote share. Results indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in FFF participation is associated with an increase in the Green Party's share by .13 standard deviations. Then, we estimate the relationship between FFF participation and the change in the Greens' vote share between 2015 and 2019. A one-standard-deviation increase in participation is associated with an increase of .054 standard deviations at the municipality level. Finally, in column 3, we estimate the same specification as in column 2 at the county level in the Greens' vote gains between 2015 and 2019. Unlike the municipality-level measure of protest participation, the county-level measure does not depend on weights (see section \ref*{eq_greta_cons:participation_index}). Both the coefficient and significance level increase slightly using the county-level measure but are otherwise very similar to the municipality-level results. 





\subsection{Additional Control Variables}


%--------------------------------------------
% Tab: inclusion controls
\input{greta_cons_tab__greens_controls}
%--------------------------------------------

In Figure 6, we have seen considerable variation in the Greens' vote share and participation in climate strikes, especially between East and West Germany. Therefore, one might be concerned that underlying factors, such as economic differences or differences in the age structure that may explain variation in the vote share of the Green Party and FFF participation, may also explain intra-state variation in these variables. It is thinkable, for example, that environmental awareness has increased more between 2015 and 2019 among the relatively wealthy and young compared to the relatively poor and old. This could be, for example, due to an increasing number of reports in the media on climate change and environment-related topics during the same time period that the relatively wealthy and young are more likely to consume and to internalize than the relatively poor and old. In a similar vein, it is possible that urban-rural differences in a range of factors (education, wealth, cultural attitudes, political priorities) may explain both the substantial (increases in) vote shares and high FFF participation rates. 

In Table 3, we, therefore, show the main results including additional control variables: per capita income (column 2), the unemployment rate (column 3), the age structure, and an indicator variable for population density (column 4)\footnote{Population density is an indicator variable that is 1 for all municipalities with above-median population density.}. It is reassuring to see that the coefficient sizes remain very similar throughout all specifications. The significance levels decrease slightly but remain below or just above the 5 percent level. 

\subsection{Voter Turnout as a Potential Mechanism}

%--------------------------------------------
% Tab - voter_turnout
\input{greta_cons_tab__voter_turnout}
%--------------------------------------------

So far, the results have shown that the vote share of the Green party increased more in municipalities with higher protest participation. The question arises whether protest participation may have prompted those to vote who had abstained in the previous election. For example, labeling the European elections as “climate elections,” for example, may have mobilized voters who would otherwise have abstained. We show in Table \ref{tab_greta_cons:associations_part_turnout} that higher FFF participation is significantly correlated with higher turnout, both at the municipality- and county-level. Although protest participation is not significantly linked to the level of voter turnout, we see that a one standard deviation in the participation index is associated with .08 standard deviations in voter turnout.


% ROBUSTNESS %--------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Robustness Tests}

We perform several sensitivity tests to assess the robustness of the findings. Overall, the sensitivity tests demonstrate that the main results are robust to other specifications of measuring climate strike participation, indicating that protest participation levels correlate with electoral outcomes.

% figure cutoff distances
\input{greta_cons_fig__cutoff_distances}
%--------------------------------------------

\textbf{Alternative cutoff distances for the Climate Strike Participation Index.---}In the process of constructing the climate strike participation index, we tried to be as flexible as possible. In principle, we allow every region to be a potential place of origin for any climate strike in Germany. In practice, however, participants are likely to come from nearby municipalities. This is also what we see in our data (see for instance Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:strike_participation_hh_ber}). In the first robustness test shown in Figure \ref{fig_greta_cons:origin_cutoff_distances}, we try to accommodate the insight about the locality of catchment areas for the individual strikes. To be precise, we limit the set of origin geographies based on the proximity to the strikes' location. The figure reports estimates and confidence intervals when estimating Equation \ref{eq_greta_cons:fd_vote_share_greens} with the additional restriction of using only origins that are within a certain radius to the destination. The results show that choosing any cutoff of more than 20 kilometers will lead to positive and significant estimates that are similar to our baseline results presented earlier. Coefficient sizes decrease when using cutoffs that can realistically be seen as too small, i.e. of less than 17 kilometers. There is no significant correlation between strike participation and changes in the Greens' vote share when using these smaller distances.


\textbf{Alternative participation measures.---}The climate strike participation measure used throughout this paper is the residualized number of movements between origin and destination pairs. We measure journeys between origins and destinations and remove the variation predicted by y origin-destination pair fixed effect, the day of the week, the week of the year, the month, public and school holidays, and the weather at the origin and destination. This model explains a large part of the number of origin-destination journeys with an adjusted $R^2 = 0.97$. In Table \ref{tab_greta_cons:alternative_participation_measures}, we show results when using even more stringent definitions by interacting origin-destination fixed effects with week- and month-fixed effects (column 2) and with week-, month-, and day-of-the-week fixed effects (column 3). Panel A shows results when using OLS, and Panel B presents estimates when using a Poisson model to account for the discrete nature of the dependent variable. The coefficient sizes remain similar to the baseline specification in column 1, while the standard errors increase slightly.

\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sec_greta_cons:conclusion}

This paper studies the relationship between participation in school strikes for climate and voter behavior in Germany over course of 2019, the peak of the FFF movement. To do so, this paper develops a novel strategy to track the origin of climate protest participants exploiting cell phone-based tracking data. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper to study whether climate protest participation may have changed voting behavior towards more climate-oriented political parties. Our results suggest that climate protest participation is related to increased voter turnouts and a higher vote share for the Green party. These findings suggest that participating in climate protests may have influenced environmental awareness and political priorities. Furthermore, environmental mass movements may be an effective means to increase incentives for politicians to implement policies aimed at mitigating climate change, which typically materialize the long-run. 



The novel strategy may also be applied to other contexts in which movements and gatherings of large number of people matter, such as in political uprisings or revolutions. (This sounds somehow weak, needs tweaking.)

The paper also speaks to the literature on value transmission. Most studies in this literature study parents-to-child transmissions. What is interesting about studying the Fridays for Future climate strikes is that these were predominantly attended by schoolchildren, whereas parents are the ones who vote. While we do not have direct information on child-to-parents value transmissions, our results are indicative that children transmitted their increased environmental awareness to their parents.
